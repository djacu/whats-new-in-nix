As of Nix version 2.10, nix search has a new flag, exclude, to filter out packages.

Here we have a command to search nixpkgs for zeromq.

If we run it, we get a list of all packages that have zeromq in the name or description.

Here we add the exclude flag to our command to filter out any packages that mention python.

And you can see, nix search has excluded those packages.

We can also exclude multiple things.

By wrapping the argument to exclude in quotes and using the pipe operator.

And now the list is much shorter.
