As of Nix version 2.10, a new builtin function traceVerbose is available.

It is similar to the trace function, but must be enabled explicitely otherwise it behaves as a No-op.

Here we have a command that uses the traceVerbose function.

If we run it, it will simply return "one".

And here we have another command that enables the trace-verbose option.

If it run it, it will also print our message.
